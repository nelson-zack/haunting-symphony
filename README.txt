Gameplay
The objective of this game is to survive against the monster in the dark. In order to do this effectively, you must search for safe houses in the woods. You can use audio cues to get an idea of the distance, direction, and even the intentions of the monster. In the cabins, you will find supplies which can restore your sanity and replenish your battery. In one of the cabins, you can find a weapon which can be used to kill the monster and proceed to the next level. Be careful though, just as you can kill the monster with a single well timed attack, so can the monster eliminate you.


Controls are:
Movement: WASD
Jump: spacebar
Sprint: shift +  WASD
Camera: mouse 
Flashlight: F
Interact with objects (cabin doors/weapons): E
Attack: left mouse button when weapon is equipped.

Resources/suggestions for future students:
* What resources did you find particularly helpful?
   * The Unreal Marketplace was fantastic for finding free assets to use, but their selection may not include a free version of something you specifically need
   * This guys youtube channel taught so many things we needed: https://www.youtube.com/@GorkaGames
   * Just being able to sit down for a couple hours and google relevant keywords to find a potential solution is a great thing.




* What suggestions would you have for future students?
   * Do not procrastinate on getting your sections done for any given sprint, and do not procrastinate starting your game.
   * Bugs will arise constantly, be creative in solving them, and realize that this isn’t a triple A game studio. A solution you can bodge together now may be totally sufficient in place of a much more complex and time consuming one.
   * Be sure the scale of your project matches the amount of time you are going ot put into it. Something too ambitious/difficult may be left lacking if not given the time and effort required.
